# Pyret-lang.vim

This vim configuration is mostly based on the one in the [Pyret Repository](https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/tree/master/tools/vim).
I have made a copy here mostly for the convience of use with plugin managers like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

### Example Installation
For vim-plug, add the following:
```
Plug 'rachitnigam/pyret-lang.vim'
```

### Changes from Original
- Added filetype detection.
- Defined `commentstring` to be used with NERDCommenter.
