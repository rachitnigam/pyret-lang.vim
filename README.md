# Pyret-lang.vim

This vim configuration is a fork of the minimal file from the [Pyret
Repository](https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/tree/master/tools/vim).

It aims to bring better language editting for the Pyret Programming language.
Currently, it provides better highlighting, auto-indentation, and snippets
for [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips).

### Installation
For vim-plug, add the following:
```
Plug 'rachitnigam/pyret-lang.vim'
```

Install [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) for snippet support.
