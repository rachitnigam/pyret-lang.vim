# Pyret-lang.vim

This vim configuration is a fork of the minimal file from the [Pyret
Repository](https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/tree/master/tools/vim).
This repository aims to bring the highlighting in pyret to reasonable
completion and better highlighting than the original.

This repository also makes it to manage this plugin with plugin managers like
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

### Example Installation
For vim-plug, add the following:
```
Plug 'rachitnigam/pyret-lang.vim'
```
